## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/junwei_wang.jpg" >}}

I am a cryptography engineer at [CryptoExperts](https://www.cryptoexperts.com/) in Paris since 2017.
I mainly work on [white-box cryptography](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.700.7995&rep=rep1&type=pdf) and privacy-preserving cryptography.

Before that, I was a senior software engineer at [Baidu](https://www.baidu.com) in Beijing from 2015 to 2017.

I co-organized the [2nd edition](https://whibox.io/contests/2019/) and the [3rd edition](https://whibox.io/contests/2021/) of the [WhibOx](https://whibox.github.io/) contest, which are the CTF events of [CHES 2019](https://ches.iacr.org/2019/) and [CHES 2021](https://ches.iacr.org/2019/).

I am also a member of the following program committees:

- [CHES 2022](https://ches.iacr.org/2022/callforpapers.php)
- CHES 2022 artifact review committee
- [ICSP 2021](https://icsp.co.in/)
- [CHES 2021 artifact review committee](https://ches.iacr.org/2021/artifacts.php).


## Education

I obtained my Ph.D. degree in cryptography in 2020 from the [University of Luxembourg](https://uni.lu), and from the [University Paris 8](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/) under the supervision of [Jean-Sébastien CORON](http://www.crypto-uni.lu/jscoron/index.html), [Sihem MESNAGER](http://www.math.univ-paris13.fr/~mesnager/), [Pascal PAILLIER](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xwzhjfoAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Matthieu RIVAIN](http://www.matthieurivain.com/).
The defense of my thesis entitled **On the practical security of white-box cryptography**, took place in June 24, 2020.
Please find more information in [jwa.ng/thesis](/thesis).

Before that, I received my master degrees in computer science from [the University of Luxembourg](https://uni.lu) and [Shandong University](https://en.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2015.

Before that, I received my bachelor degree in software engineering from [Shandong University](https://en.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2012.
