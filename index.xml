Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren&amp;#39;t special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jwa.ng/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jwa.ng/contact/</guid><description> Contact Email: me@jwa.ng / jwang@mailorg.com

Currently, I work as a cryptography expert at CryptoExperts, a service and technology company in cryptography. I also conducted my doctoral study at CryptoExperts.
My current work and research interests are white-box cryptography and privacy-preserving cryptography. In particular, I build and/or break white-box implementations for cryptographic primitives deployed in untrusted computation environment; And I apply cutting-edge research results in cryptography to enhance the user&amp;#39;s privacy and to protect customer&amp;#39;s intellectual property.</description></item></channel></rss>
